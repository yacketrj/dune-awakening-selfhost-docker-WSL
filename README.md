Dune Docker Console is a Docker-based self-hosting package for Dune: Awakening with a built-in browser admin panel. Install it on a fresh server, open the Web UI, finish setup in the wizard, and manage players, maps, backups, updates, live tools, and server operations without living in the terminal.

This project is unofficial. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or supported by Funcom.

## Requirements

You do not need to be a Linux expert. Start with a fresh server and the installer will check the basics for you.

| What you need | Plain Explanation |
|---|---|
| A server | Ubuntu/Linux is the easiest path. Docker Desktop on Windows/WSL2 or a VM can also work. |
| Docker | You can start even if Docker is not ready yet. On supported Linux servers, the installer prepares Docker for you. |
| Funcom token | You will paste this into the browser setup wizard. |
| CPU support | The game server needs AVX/AVX2. Most modern dedicated servers and VPS plans expose this. |
| Disk space | 100 GB or more is recommended. |
| Web access | Open the Web UI on port `8088` from your browser. The console binds to `127.0.0.1` by default; opt into LAN/public binding only when protected by a firewall, VPN, or TLS reverse proxy. |

Memory Guide:

RAM decides how many Dune map servers you can keep running comfortably. Start with the basic layout if you are unsure. Add more RAM when you want more maps online at the same time or expect heavier player activity.

| Server Layout | Recommended RAM |
|---|---:|
| Basic server for getting started | 20 GB |
| Main world plus extra story/social maps | 30 GB |
| Main world, extra maps, and Deep Desert | 40 GB |
| Many always-on maps or heavier player activity | 60 GB+ |

Forward these ports for public/internet hosting:

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `8088` | TCP | Web admin setup panel. Keep local-only unless access is protected for trusted admins. |
| `31982` | TCP | Game messaging |
| `7777-7810` | UDP | Game traffic |

Keep database and internal admin ports private.

## Getting Started

Copy and paste this on a fresh Linux server:

```bash
bash -c 'set -euo pipefail; if ! command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1; then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl tar; fi; mkdir -p "$HOME/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker"; cd "$HOME/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker"; latest_url="$(curl -fsSLI -o /dev/null -w "%{url_effective}" https://github.com/Red-Blink/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker/releases/latest)"; version="${latest_url##*/}"; curl -fsSL "https://github.com/Red-Blink/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker/archive/refs/tags/${version}.tar.gz" | tar -xz --strip-components=1; chmod +x install.sh; ./install.sh'
```

The installer downloads the latest release, prepares the server, starts the Web UI, and tells you what address to open in your browser. The Web UI controls the Docker daemon, so it defaults to local access on `127.0.0.1`. To expose it beyond the host, explicitly set `ADMIN_BIND_HOST=auto` or a trusted interface and protect access with a firewall, VPN, or TLS-terminating reverse proxy. Do not directly expose TCP `8088` to the public internet.

## Docker Socket Access

The Web UI uses the local Docker socket so it can start, stop, update, and inspect the server containers. This is powerful host-level access, so only expose the Web UI to trusted admins.

If setup says the Docker socket is permission denied, run this from the repo root:

```bash
DOCKER_SOCKET_GID="$(stat -c '%g' /var/run/docker.sock)" dune console restart
```

On a normal Linux install this is usually detected automatically. The command above is mainly for custom Docker setups where the socket group differs from the default container groups.

## Community Addons

Dune Docker Console includes a Community Addons area for extra tools built by the community. Server owners can discover, install, enable, and remove addons from the Web UI without replacing the main console.

Addons are designed to let the community experiment with new panels, reports, helpers, and server-owner workflows while keeping the core console clean. Each addon declares what it needs before it is installed, so server owners can review permissions first.

Have an idea you want to build for Dune Docker Console? Start with the official addon template:

```text
https://github.com/Red-Blink/dune-docker-addon-template
```

The template gives addon developers a ready-to-use structure, examples, validation, and GitHub release packaging. Build your addon in its own repo, publish a release, then submit it to the community addons list when it is ready for others to try.

## Contributing & Project Notes

- Issues, fixes, and improvements are welcome.
- This project is community maintained and experimental.
- Funcom self-hosting behavior may change over time.
- Keep secrets, generated runtime files, and backups out of git.
- Do not expose the Web UI to untrusted users.
- Security-sensitive changes should follow the PR gates in `docs/security-gates.md`, use the transparency template, and keep evidence in `docs/changes/`.
