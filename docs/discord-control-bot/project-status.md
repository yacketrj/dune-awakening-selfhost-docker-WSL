# Dune Discord Companion Bot - Project Status

## Current Status

The Discord companion bot is in an experimental read-only integration phase.

The current implementation validates the protected Console adapter path and the bot command layer without enabling any write, destructive, database mutation, Docker control, or addon mutation behavior.

## Current Bot Commands

| Command | Minimum Role | Output |
|---|---:|---|
| `/dune health` | Public | Adapter health |
| `/dune status` | Public | Public redacted status output |
| `/dune status detail` | Admin | Detailed redacted diagnostic output |

| `/dune services` | Observer | Service summary |

## Validation Status

Latest local validation reported:

- Console Discord adapter tests: 37 passing, 0 failing.
- Bot tests: 3 passing, 0 failing.
- Bot secret scan: passing after runtime-assembled redaction fixtures.
- Bot scaffold validation: passing after narrowing validation to capability literals.
- Live HTTP checks: status, readiness, services, and detailed status returned `200 OK` with matching role policy.

New CI evidence added:

- Semgrep CE SAST workflow on pull request, push, manual dispatch, and weekly schedule.
- Trivy filesystem and Discord bot image scan workflow on pull request, push, manual dispatch, and weekly schedule.
- CVSS-ranked vulnerability report with CVE/NVD URLs when CVE IDs are present.

## Roadmap

### P0 - Foundation and Governance

Status: mostly complete.

Completed items include the isolated bot workspace, security gates, redaction tests, authorization tests, protected adapter docs, Semgrep workflow, Trivy workflow, vulnerability reporting, SOC 2 readiness matrix, scheduled readiness workflow, and setup/admin/user documentation.

### P1 - Read-Only Operational Visibility

Status: in progress.

Completed:

- Health.
- Public redacted status.
- Admin detailed redacted status.
- Readiness.
- Services.

Remaining:

- Population summary.
- Logs with cap/redaction/role gate.
- Map state.
- Backup list/latest metadata.
- Real Discord client connection and slash command registration.

### P2 - Operational Hardening

Status: not started.

Planned:

- Rate limits.
- Alerting.
- Bot heartbeat.
- Public/admin channel mapping.
- Emergency disable flag.
- Evidence retention policy.
- SBOM generation and image signing for release candidates.

### P3 - Future Review Gate

Status: blocked by design.

No write, destructive, credential, database mutation, addon mutation, player mutation, map mutation, or Docker/service lifecycle command may be added without a separate threat model, approval, DAST cases, audit policy, and rollback plan.

## SOC 2 Readiness Position

This project maintains SOC 2-aligned readiness evidence. It does not claim SOC 2 certification or produce a SOC 2 report. A formal SOC 2 report requires an independent CPA examination.

The recurring readiness workflow checks documentation, safety markers, tests, secret scanning, Semgrep/Trivy workflow presence, vulnerability report generation logic, and scaffold validation on a weekly cadence and on relevant repository changes.
