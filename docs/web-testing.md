# Web Testing

This document tracks how to verify the RedBlink web admin while feature parity is built.

## Automated Test Requirements

Backend tests must cover:

- command allowlist
- service validation
- path validation
- secret redaction
- auth middleware
- CSRF protection for state-changing requests
- task lifecycle
- task log streaming redaction
- Docker status parsing
- database connection discovery
- backup/restore task creation
- admin command wrappers
- SQL destructive detection
- direct DB mutation capability/ownership checks
- RabbitMQ broadcast payload validation

Frontend tests must cover:

- API client request/response handling
- critical pages render
- setup wizard state
- player/admin action forms
- dangerous confirmation dialogs
- log viewer redaction/search/pause behavior

## Current Verification

Current verification:

- `npm test` in `admin-server/` passes.
- `npm run build` in `web/` passes.
- Backend tests currently cover signed sessions, CSRF rejection/acceptance, service validation, command allowlist, lifecycle/status/doctor mappings, logs command validation, noninteractive update flags, backup restore/delete name validation, admin catalog validation, item/item-id/template grant validation, XP/quantity/durability bounds, skill point/module validation, teleport/vehicle argument validation, SQL read-only/destructive detection, direct DB config discovery, identifier validation, table preview query building, player search parameterization, direct currency and faction mutation query behavior, direct inventory delete ownership validation, storage give-item validation/insert query behavior, unsupported mutation capability responses, RabbitMQ broadcast/shutdown payload validation, task creation/completion, and secret redaction.
- Phase 5A verification on this pass: `npm test` in `admin-server/` passed and `npm run build` in `web/` passed. No live DB write or live RabbitMQ broadcast was executed from the web during automated verification.
- Phase 3 live read-only DB smoke check connected to `127.0.0.1:15432` as `dune`, detected 179 Dune tables, listed 1 player, and verified storage/base/blueprint list queries plus actor `82` inventory/currency/faction/spec reads. No writes were run.
- `docker compose -f docker-compose.web.yml config` passed previously.
- HTTP bind smoke test could not run inside the sandbox because binding returned `EPERM`.


## Manual Verification Pattern

For every feature promoted to Done, add a note with:

- web page/component used
- API endpoint called
- RedBlink command, SQL, Docker, or RabbitMQ operation executed
- whether a backup was created
- confirmation prompt used for destructive actions
- expected output or state change

## Mock Mode

Mock mode is allowed only for UI development. It must be clearly separated from real mode and must not be used as evidence that a feature is Done.
