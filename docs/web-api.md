# Web API

The RedBlink web API is intentionally not a shell proxy. Endpoints must call allowlisted RedBlink commands, direct Postgres logic, direct RabbitMQ logic, or Docker/Compose inspection/control with validation.

Base path for the native RedBlink API: `/api`.

## Not Done Yet


- `/api/players/:id/set-currency`
- `/api/admin/whisper` returns explicit unsupported capability response until RedBlink exposes or seeds a verified GM courier identity for `chat.whispers`
- player progression/events/stats/history deep schema mapping
- `/api/maps/update`
- `/api/sietches/update`
- `/api/deepdesert/update`
- `/api/setup/install-docker`

Phase 1 cleanup must either implement these for real or remove/quarantine their frontend controls.


The full route inventory and RedBlink implementation paths are in `docs/web-feature-parity-plan.md`.
